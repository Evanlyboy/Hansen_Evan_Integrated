Evan's Computer Shop
A final intergrated project website for Interactive Media Development 3D Visualization
By: Evan Hansen

> Usually my projects are a lot more ambitious than what I have here but I only have a limited tool set to create as of right now and I didn't want it to be too confusing 
with features and plans I want to implement. So here is my basic but hopefully unique and interesting website

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
> This is the index page where I have other, theorhetical links to other parts of the website. It has some short ads, and shows what's on offer
